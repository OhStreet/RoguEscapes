                <h3>Welcome to RoguEscapes!</h3> 
                <h3>This blog is all about videogames of the roguelike genre.</h3>
                <h4>Why This Topic?</h4>
                <p>Video games have been a hobby of mine for most of my life. As I've grown and my responsibilities have shifted, I find it harder to commit to larger titles due to time constraints and other interests. Because of this, indie games have become my primary outlet, with a particular focus on roguelikes. They allow me to feel satisfied and accomplished even during shorter play sessions.  I decided to create a blog about them for this project because it sounded fun and easy for me to write content about.</p>
                <h4>What is a Roguelike?</h4>
                <p>To put it simply, roguelikes are non-committal games that you can easily 'pick up and play,' while still offering a lot of replayability. The gameplay loop typically involves navigating through a series of levels, often divided into acts, with a boss or event at the end of each act. Each run brings a fresh experience; elements like levels, enemies, and loot can vary widely through RNG or procedural generation, ensuring that no two playthroughs feel the same. This blend of accessibility and variety makes roguelikes an engaging genre that keeps players coming back for more.</p>
